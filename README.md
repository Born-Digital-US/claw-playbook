# CLAW Vagrant Playbook
[![LICENSE](https://img.shields.io/badge/license-MIT-blue.svg?style=flat-square)](./LICENSE)

## Introduction

The is an Ansible playbook for Islandora CLAW. It also has a vagrant file to bring up a development
environment virtual machine for Islandora CLAW.

This virtual machine **should not** be used in production **yet**.

## Requirements

1. [VirtualBox](https://www.virtualbox.org/)
2. [Vagrant](http://www.vagrantup.com/) 1.8.5+
3. [git](https://git-scm.com/)
4. [ansible](https://www.ansible.com/community) 2.3+

## Variables

### System Resources

By default the virtual machine that is built uses 3GB of RAM. Your host machine will need to be able to support the additional memory use. You can override the CPU and RAM allocation by creating `ISLANDORA_VAGRANT_CPUS` and `ISLANDORA_VAGRANT_MEMORY` environment variables and setting the values. For example, on an Ubuntu host you could add to `~/.bashrc`:

```bash
export ISLANDORA_VAGRANT_CPUS=4
export ISLANDORA_VAGRANT_MEMORY=4096
```

## Use

1. clone the repo
2. `vagrant up`

## Connect

You can connect to the machine via the browser at [http://localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000).

## Roadmap

1. Get feature parity with [CLAW Vagrant](https://github.com/Islandora-CLAW/claw_vagrant)
2. Break each role out into its own git repo, so they can be listed on galaxy
3. Test install on multiple boxes
4. Test with other operating systems (?)
